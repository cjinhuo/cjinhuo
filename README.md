Here are some tiny tools I created:🎉

- 📟 A [interesting toy](https://cjinhuo.github.io/morse/) of Morse code which could visualize Morse code in binary tree to train you memorize those codes easily and deeply.
- 🔍 A [text search engine](https://github.com/cjinhuo/text-search-engine) that relies on a dynamic programming algorithm and supports fuzzy search with pinyin.
- ⚒️ A [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjgablnemienkegdnbihhemebmmonihg) for searching tabs, bookmarks, and history with support for fuzzy Pinyin search which let you switch or create tab you want in blazing speed.
- ⌨ A tiny parser for [parsing](https://cjinhuo.github.io/thrift-to-json-schema/) thrift to JSON schema
- 📦 A set of scripts are preset for [monorepo](https://github.com/cjinhuo/mono-sdk-boilerplate) with Pnpm + changeset + nx
